After finishing my graduate school applications, I wanted to spend the winter break continuing to build my coding skills while also searching for internships for the summer before graduate school. After learning about Jekyll's static sites in Markdown / HTML and the hosting offered by Github Pages, I thought it would be the perfect way to combine those two goals. 

Building this site was (and continues to be) a great experience to learning HTML and Git version control, while also showcasing the projects and experiences I have had over the years. I will continue to update the site to improve its functionality and aesthetics and as I continue to learn more HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (thanks to [freecodecamp.org](freecodecamp.org)).
