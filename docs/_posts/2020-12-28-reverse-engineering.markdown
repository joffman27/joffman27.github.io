title: CAD and Thermodynamics - Willys Jeep Engine Report

In this project, I took apart an old Willys Jeep engine (in my living room, thanks to COVID), created the engine block in CAD, and then wrote a report on the cylinder's engine thermodynamics. This was an interesting project for me since I struggled with Thermodynamics when I took the course, but it was a great opportunity to build my knowledge and stay on top of the subject. The CAD was all done in SolidWorks, and some Python was used to write a script to plot the engine's Otto Cycle. The purpose of this exercise was to take engine measurements, and then use them to try to reverse engineer the engine's horsepower and full Otto Cycle process.

This is a SolidWorks drawing with GD&T of the engine's cylinder head: 

This is the full report (with calculations) analyzing and plotting the engine's Otto Cycle in order to estimate horsepower:
