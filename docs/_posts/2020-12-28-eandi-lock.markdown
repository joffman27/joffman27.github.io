For this project, our group created a combination lock using circuitry, including XOR and NOR chips, LEDs, rectifier diodes, slide switches, and more. The user was required to input the correct combination on the switches in order to "unlock" the circuit, which was represented by an LED. 

The following is a photo of the completed device:
