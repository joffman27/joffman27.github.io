At the Hopkins Extreme Materials Institute, I participated in research involving the behavior of granular boron carbide undergoing high-speed shear loads. 

I helped perform pressure shear plate impact (PSPI) that used laser interferometers to acquire stress data in multiple planes, such that the impact of increasing shear stress could be analyzed. The following is a research poster I presented at the HEMI Research Symposium:
