The purpose of this project was to design a Stirling Engine in CAD, and then use various manufacturing processes to fabricate the device in the machine shop. 

These included casting the flywheel and then turning it on the lathe to smooth it out, milling the block required to hold the arm, bending the sheet metal legs, and more. It was a fun experience to understanding the limits of CAD, proper tolerancing, and hands on machining.
