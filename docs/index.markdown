**Nice to meet you!**  

My name is **Jonah Offman**, and I am a senior at **Johns Hopkins University** majoring in **Mechanical Engineering** and minoring in French. I'm also currently a right handed pitcher and captain of the Johns Hopkins varsity baseball team, teaching assistant, and member of the Sports Analytics Club. I'm passionate about **mechanical design**, **robotics and control systems**, and the **interactions between software and hardware**. 

I created this site both as a way to showcase the work I've done over the years and as an (ongoing) coding exercise, as I am slightly obsessed with growing my coding abilities. Feel free to navigate the sidebar to check out my full resume and see more detail about my past experiences and projects, or stick around on the homepage to get a quick overview.
